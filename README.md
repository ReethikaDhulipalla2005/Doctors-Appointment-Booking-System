# Doctors-Appointment-Booking-System
The Doctor’s Appointment Booking System is a full-stack MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js,
Node.js) web application designed to simplify healthcare appointment management. It supports three
user roles—Admin, Doctor, and Patient—each with dedicated functionality. Patients can register, browse
doctors by specialization, view availability, book appointments and cancel appointments. Doctors can
manage their profiles, view appointments, and update the status of their appointments. Admins can
manage users and doctors, decide doctor availability and cancel appointments. The app features secure
JWT-based authentication, responsive UI with React and Tailwind CSS and RESTful API integration.
